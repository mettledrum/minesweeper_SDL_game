	-run it:		./minesweeper

DESCRIPTION:
	This is just a minesweeper game, nothing that special.  It has three 
levels for you to play, and some pretty pictures to look at in the background 
while playing.  SDL and Lazy Foo' Productions made this really easy to create 
once I had the Board class created.  I used some of Lazy Foo's sub-programs 
for loading the images onto SDL_Surfaces because they were very nicely organized.

DIFFERENCES:
	There are a few differences between this and the standard MS game.  
If you lay a flag down, the flag doesn't stop an expansion from taking place.  
The game just mocks you in the end whether or not you win by showing where 
your incorrect flag markings were.  Also, this version does not give you a 
click for free at the beginning like the Microsoft version; if you click on 
a mine anytime, you blow up.  Obviously, the dimensions and mine counts are 
customized.
